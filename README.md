# resume

A LaTex resume deployed with GH Actions

Based off Jake's Resume.

# Getting started

1. On the `https://github.com/cooperellidge/resume`, select "Use this template" > "Create a new repository"
2. Create a new branch called `gh-pages`
3. Clone that repo locally
4. Modify the resume.tex file
5. To view the local changes, install TeX on your machine and compile `resume.tex`. If you are using VS Code, I suggest using the LaTeX Workshop extension (james-yu.latex-workshop) and following their instructions.
6. Once you are happy, push your changes to `main`
7. Navigate to your gh pages site, e.g. `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/resume.pdf`

Now edit the resume.tex file or the entire repo itself!
